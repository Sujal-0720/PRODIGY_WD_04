                <p>Fire Alarm Using Smoke Detection: Project Summary
                    Objective: Create a fire alarm system that detects smoke and triggers an alert.

                    Components:

                    Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno)

                    Smoke Sensor (e.g., MQ-2 or MQ-6)

                    Buzzer and LEDs

                    Miscellaneous items: resistors, capacitors, wires, breadboard, and power supply

                    Principle:

                    Smoke Detection: The smoke sensor detects smoke particles and sends a signal.

                    Signal Processing: The microcontroller reads the sensor's signal. If it exceeds a threshold, smoke is detected.

                    Alarm Activation: Upon detection, the microcontroller activates the buzzer and LEDs, providing both auditory and visual alerts.

                    Steps:

                    Setup: Connect the Arduino to your computer and upload the code to read the smoke sensor's output.

                    Component Connection: Attach the smoke sensor, buzzer, and LEDs to the breadboard and connect to the Arduino.

                    Coding: Program the Arduino to monitor the sensor and trigger the alarm.

                    Testing: Generate smoke to test the alarm system.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>Developed a freelancing platform for the Government of Punjab tailored to support both beginner and experienced freelancers, addressing a gap in existing platforms like Upwork or Guru, which focus on experienced professionals. The platform provides a structured pathway for beginners through tutorial classes with certification, enabling those with little to no freelancing experience to build essential skills. After completing tutorials, users receive hands-on practice through sample projects designed to simulate real client work. Successful completion of these projects unlocks access to live opportunities, while additional sample work is provided to those who need further preparation, ensuring readiness before interacting with clients.

                    To enhance engagement, the platform incorporates a gamified experience, tracking each user's activity, progress, and achievements. Users can monitor their growth through a ranking system, motivating them to complete tasks and earn higher ratings. This gamified element not only encourages skill development but also makes the process enjoyable and rewarding. Profiles on the platform reflect users’ certifications, completed projects, and rankings, providing clients with a clear view of each freelancer’s capabilities and dedication. This innovative, inclusive design creates an ecosystem that nurtures beginner talent while still catering to experienced freelancers, fostering a more equitable freelancing environment.</p>
